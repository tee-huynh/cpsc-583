This tool visualizes my mobile data usage over the course of a year (Sep 2016-Sep2017) per phone application.

The following D3 examples were used for the making of my visualization -
I take no credit for the following:

Dendrogram + Horizontal Bar Chart:
https://bl.ocks.org/dahis39/f28369f0b17b456ac2f1fa9b937c5002
What I used: Code for creating and designing chart + animations
What I built off of it and made my own: Changed layout, theme, visuals.

Radial Cluster Dendrogram:
https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339607
What I used: Equation to make it radial and layout
What I built off of it and made my own: Turned it into a legend with interactions and linking it to a multiline chart with 
options to select and deselect applications.

Although I did not create this visualization alone (with credit to the above mentioned), I believe I was able to create something unique by combining different charts and finding a way to integrate them all within my visualization tool. Each chart was necessary in order to showcase and handle the hierarchical data and handling multiple values to compare and I was able to add unique additions in order to make the visualizations easier to read and understand, while also matching it to the modern theme.

Note: This code was created and tested on Firefox and Chrome for Macbook.
Bug: Different browsers may have different fonts. For example, on Chrome the font of main nodes are different compared to on Firefox.
