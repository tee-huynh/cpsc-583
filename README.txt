This tool visualizes the personal Overwatch statistics of the player Teenah#11235 over the course of their experience with this video game.

The following D3 examples were used for the making of my visualization -
I take no credit for the following:

D3 Circle Bar Chart:
https://codepen.io/frankieali4/pen/GIhtd
What I used: Code for creating and designing chart + animations
What I built off of it and made my own: Added my own art and aesthetics to match my theme. 

D3 Bubble Chart:
https://codepen.io/CreativeGeek/pen/WbzXaV
What I used: Animation for switching between characters.
What I built off of it and made my own: Created my own buttons and figured out how to have a different colour for each category. Also implemented hover tool to give details.

D3 Bar Chart:

What I used: Animation, hover tooltip
What I built off of it and made my own: Rather than random animation, I changed the animation for sorting. I also added to the hover a feature of colouring each segment. Also changed scaling.

Although I did not create this visualization alone (with credit to the above mentioned), I believe I was able to create something unique by combining different charts and finding a way to integrate them all within my visualization tool. Each chart was necessary in order to showcase and handle the varying data I had (by this I mean the different measures for each category, like time versus percent) and I was able to add unique additions in order to make the visualizations easier to read and understand, while also matching it to the theme of the video game I am focusing on.

All images were made by me, using official Overwatch art as base.

Note: This code was created and tested on Firefox and Chrome for Macbook.
Bug: Different browser versions end up cutting off some of the bar chart. 
Bug: For the first time you hide a bar, it's only one click to remove but any time after that it is a double-click.

On the version of Chrome and Firefox I tested on, this was what it looked like:

Also note: For D3, I source "https://d3js.org/d3.v3.min.js" rather than having the file in my source code.
